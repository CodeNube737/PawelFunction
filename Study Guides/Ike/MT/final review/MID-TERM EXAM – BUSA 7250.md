2. Strategy: Exhibit 5.8, Porter’s Five Industry Forces (pg 101).
3. Service Operations: ISO 9000, 14000, and, especially, 27000 … What are these ISO standards and why might they be important to service operations? (pg 361).

9. Path-Goal Leadership Theory (Ex 13.4, pg 285)
10. What are the three basic “needs” theories (pg 255), and how do they compare with the “content” theories of Equity and Expectancy (pg 258 \& 262)?
11. What are the components of “Goal-Setting Theory” (pg 269)?



##### Remember:

We need all parts of the “model”.



A short explanation of each part/step/stage.



Then we need “discussion” around the model (what is good or “bad” about it, how we might apply it, what might be difficult to apply, how it might compare (or contrast) to other models, and perhaps an example of how it might be applied in an engineering company).
