## The Internet: Key Concepts
- Billions of devices connected (hosts & their apps)
- Packet switches
- Communication links / Transmission lines
- Networks of devices and links

## Important Equations
- $c = f \lambda$
- $c_{capacity} = 2B \log(SNR)$
- $f = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}$

## Frequency & Impedance Notes
- At a high enough $f$, an inductor behaves like a capacitor.
- At different $f$ values, a capacitor can act as a capacitor, a short, and an inductor, a resistor, or an open circuit.
- The impedance that the signal has on its own wire
- The impedance the wires have on each other
- This consists of both material-based impedance and EMF-based impedance

## What are ISPs?
**Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** are organizations that provide services for accessing, using, or participating in the Internet. They connect end users to the Internet and may offer additional services such as web hosting, email, and domain registration.

## Examples of Protocols
- HTTP
- TCP
- IP
- WiFi
- 4G
- 5G
- Ethernet

**Protocols** define the format and order of messages sent/received among network entities, and the actions taken upon transmission/reception.

## What is RFC?
**RFC (Request for Comments)** is a type of publication from the leading technical development and standards-setting bodies for the Internet. RFCs describe methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems.

## What is IETF?

## What is Internet Service?
**Internet service** refers to the infrastructure and programming interface that connects applications and terminals, enabling communication and data exchange over the Internet.

## Network Core
- The network core consists of interconnected routers forming a network of networks.
- Routers forward packets between networks, enabling global connectivity.

## Edge Router & Transmission Rate
- Edge routers connect end systems (hosts) to the core of the Internet.
- Transmission rate (TX-rate) is the speed at which data is sent over the access network, measured in bits per second (bps).
- Access networks can be shared or dedicated among users, affecting TX-rate.

## Access Networks Explained
- **Residential access networks:** Connect homes to the Internet via cable, DSL, or fiber.
- **Institutional access networks:** Used by schools and companies, often with higher capacity.
- **Mobile access networks:** Use wireless technologies (WiFi, 4G/5G).

### Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
- FDM transmits different channels in separate frequency bands, allowing simultaneous data and video transmission over the same cable.

### Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC)
- HFC networks combine fiber and coaxial cables to connect homes to the ISP router.
- Downstream rates: up to 40 Mbps – 1.2 Gbps
- Upstream rates: 30–100 Mbps
- Homes share the access network to the cable headend.

### ISP Router
- The ISP router connects the access network to the broader Internet, managing data flow between homes and the Internet.

### Digital Subscriber Line (DSL)
- Uses existing telephone lines to connect homes to the central office DSLAM.
- Data and voice are transmitted at different frequencies over a dedicated line.
- Downstream rates: 24–52 Mbps
- Upstream rates: 3.5–16 Mbps

### DSLAM (DSL Access Multiplexer)
- Located at the central office, DSLAM aggregates DSL connections from multiple homes and connects them to the ISP.

## Pages 21–30: Comprehensive Summary

### Wireless Access Networks
- Shared wireless access networks connect end systems to routers via base stations (access points).
- Wireless LANs (WiFi): typically within/around buildings (~100 ft), using 802.11b/g/n standards (11, 54, 450 Mbps).
- Wide-area cellular networks: provided by mobile operators, cover 10s of km, 10s Mbps, 4G/5G.

### Enterprise Networks
- Used by companies/universities.
- Mix of wired/wireless technologies, switches, and routers.
- Ethernet: wired access at 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps.
- WiFi: wireless access points at 11, 54, 450 Mbps.

### Host Packet Transmission
- Hosts break application messages into packets (length L bits).
- Packets transmitted into access network at rate R (link transmission rate/capacity/bandwidth).
- Transmission delay: $\text{delay} = \frac{L}{R}$

### Physical Media
- Guided media: signals propagate in solid media (copper, fiber, coax).
- Unguided media: signals propagate freely (radio).

#### Twisted Pair (TP)
- Two insulated copper wires.
- Category 5: 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps Ethernet.
- Category 6: 10 Gbps Ethernet.

#### Coaxial Cable
- Two concentric copper conductors.
- Bidirectional, broadband (multiple frequency channels, 100s Mbps per channel).

#### Fiber Optic Cable
- Glass fiber carrying light pulses (each pulse = bit).
- High-speed (10s–100s Gbps), low error rate, immune to electromagnetic noise.

#### Wireless Radio
- Signal carried in electromagnetic spectrum.
- No physical wire, broadcast and half-duplex.
- Propagation environment effects: reflection, obstruction by objects, interference.

##### Radio Link Types
- Terrestrial microwave: up to 45 Mbps channels.

- Wide-area (cellular): 4G cellular ~10’s Mbps.
- Satellite: up to 45 Mbps per channel, 270 msec end-to-end delay, geosynchronous vs. low-earth-orbit.

### Packet-Switching: Store-and-Forward
- Transmission delay: takes $L/R$ seconds to transmit (push out) an $L$-bit packet into a link at $R$ bps.
- Store and forward: entire packet must arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link.
- End-to-end delay: $2L/R$ (for two hops, assuming zero propagation delay).
- Example: $L = 10$ Kbits, $R = 100$ Mbps, one-hop transmission delay = 0.1 msec.

### Packet-Switching: Queueing Delay and Loss
- If arrival rate (in bps) to link exceeds transmission rate (bps) for a period of time:
  - Packets will queue, waiting to be transmitted on output link.
  - Packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) in router fills up.

## Pages 31–32: Key Concepts and Comprehension

- Comprehension Questions:
  1. What is the difference between routing and forwarding in a network core?
  2. How does a forwarding table work?
- Answers:
  1. Forwarding is local (moving a packet from the router's input to its output). Routing is a global action (router uses a routing algorithm to send packets to its destination in the WAN).
  2. Depending on a packet's header, it gets sent to a specific link, determined by the routing algorithm.

    2. TDM gives each user a time slot in which they can use the maximum bandwidth during their timeslot.

**Page 34: Packet Switching vs. Circuit Switching (user capacity example)**
- Summary: Packet switching allows more users to share a network link than circuit switching, due to statistical multiplexing.
- Comprehension Questions:
    1. Why does packet switching allow more users than circuit switching?
    2. What happens if more users are active than the network can handle?
- Answers:
    1. Packet switching—in most cases—never has enough users on at the same time to be less efficient than circuit switching.
    2. If more users are active than the network can handle, packets will experience delays and may be dropped due to buffer overflow, resulting in congestion and reduced performance.

    2. Steps: (1) Client opens TCP connection to server, (2) sends HTTP request for object, (3) server accepts connection and sends response, (4) client receives object, (5) TCP connection is closed. Repeat for each object.

**Page 104: Non-persistent HTTP—Multiple Object Requests**
- Comprehension Questions:
    1. What does the client do when a web page references multiple objects in non-persistent HTTP?
    2. Why is this process repeated for each object?

**Bob's Notes**
Con: This way takes longer the fisrt time info is requested, but saved the data at each server along the way
    • Pro: now all of the servers have the information, and it can be retrieved much faster and is more available

    • information gets saved in buffer-servers, or the cache of each server
